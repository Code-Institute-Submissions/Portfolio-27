 ### Font
-	Whilst browsing for fonts, I came across a font name called "Azonix" which was not available on popular online typography services i.e Google Fonts. This meant that i had to download the typography in a "OTF" format and use "@font-face" within the CSS. I chose this specific font as I think its aesthetically appealing and catches the users eye.
-	For the secondary font styling, I selected "Andika New Basic" with a fallback font of "sans-serif" These fonts are clean and professional
 ### Wireframe
 -	WIreframes where created prior to the develoment stages of the project. A tool called "Balsamiq" was used to provide a visual representation of how the website should look. Screenshots can be found below for each section:
